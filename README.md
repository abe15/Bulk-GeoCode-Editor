Bulk GeoCode Editor  is a custom web app to make it easier and faster for geocoders to label addresses , without having to edit each geocode individually.

This tool enables a geocoder to:

    Visualize Delivery points and corresponding road entry points on a Map
        Load txt files containing a geojson representation of addresses and associated geocodes and view points for each address on satellite or Mapbox backgrounds.
        View geofence radius around the DP 
    Edit Geocodes Quickly
        Hover over delivery point or road entry point
        Hold CTRL to  lock current selection
        While holding CTRL, left click to move delivery point or right click to move road entry point
        To edit tolerance, edit tolerance input text field and click update.
        To make mulitple selections, hold SHIFT button and draw bounding box over points that need to be selected. Edit as one group of points.



I used MapboxGL api, Redux for state store, Typescript, JSX, Javascript as main programming language, Material UI for UI components, and React as the front end framework.
